# nixbot CI service for magnetite, standing beside the buildbot-nix server.
#
# Credential generator catalog (slots; values populated as marked):
#   - nixbot-github-app-secret-key: manual `clan vars set` (GitHub App PEM key)
#   - nixbot-github-oauth-secret: manual `clan vars set` (OAuth client secret)
#   - nixbot-github-webhook-secret: auto-generated
# Each names nixbot.service in restartUnits because the unit snapshots its
# credentials at start, so a rotation without a restart leaves the running
# service holding the superseded value.
#
# Coexistence constraints (buildbot stays authoritative for every repository):
#   - statusContextPrefix is left at its default "nixbot"; buildbot's contexts
#     are "buildbot/..." and the forge's required checks name those.
#   - github.topic is null; its default "build-with-buildbot" is the topic
#     buildbot's repositories carry, and it one-shot-imports on an empty DB.
#   - nginx.enable stays true, so the service listens only on
#     /run/nixbot/web.sock and binds no TCP port (its TCP fallback default
#     8010 is also the nixpkgs buildbot default).
#   - A dedicated GitHub App, not buildbot's (id 3305657, buildbot.nix:129):
#     nixbot needs Checks write and the check_run/check_suite events, which
#     buildbot-nix does not, so sharing would edit a running service's
#     registration.
#
# github.enable is false until the dedicated GitHub App exists. Its numeric
# app id and OAuth client id are public identifiers produced by registering
# that application, and github.appId has no default, so the integration
# cannot evaluate before they are known. Enabling it is a four-line edit:
# github.enable = true, github.appId, github.oauthId, and the oauthSecretFile
# reference to the third generator below (oauthId and oauthSecretFile are
# asserted together upstream, so neither can land alone).
