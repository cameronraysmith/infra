# nixbot CI service for magnetite, standing beside the buildbot-nix server.
#
# Credential generator catalog (slots; values populated as marked):
#   - nixbot-github-app-secret-key: manual `clan vars set` (GitHub App PEM key)
#   - nixbot-github-oauth-secret: manual `clan vars set` (OAuth client secret)
#   - nixbot-github-webhook-secret: auto-generated
# Each names nixbot.service in restartUnits because the unit snapshots its
# credentials at start, so a rotation without a restart leaves the running
# service holding the superseded value.
#
# Coexistence constraints (buildbot still runs, serving Gitea repositories):
#   - statusContextPrefix is left at its default "nixbot"; buildbot's contexts
#     are "buildbot/...", so the two verdict namespaces stay distinct.
#   - github.topic is null; its default "build-with-buildbot" is the topic
#     buildbot's repositories carry, and it one-shot-imports on an empty DB.
#   - nginx.enable stays true, so the service listens only on
#     /run/nixbot/web.sock and binds no TCP port (its TCP fallback default
#     8010 is also the nixpkgs buildbot default).
#   - A dedicated GitHub App, not buildbot's (id 3305657, buildbot.nix:129):
#     nixbot needs Checks write and the check_run/check_suite events, which
#     buildbot-nix does not, so sharing would edit a running service's
#     registration.
#
# The webhook secret has two sources and they must agree. The application was
# registered through GitHub's App manifest flow, which generated a webhook
# secret of its own; the nixbot-github-webhook-secret generator below
# independently generates a different one. This generator is authoritative, so
# the application's webhook secret must be replaced with its value at
# deployment, or every delivery fails signature validation.
