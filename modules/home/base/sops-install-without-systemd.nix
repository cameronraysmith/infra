        installing sops secrets from a home-manager activation entry when no
        systemd user manager is running.

        On Linux sops-nix installs secrets through a systemd user service, and
        its own activation entry only restarts that unit. Where standalone
        home-manager runs without a session bus and user manager, as in a
        container or a hosted agent sandbox, the unit never starts and secrets
        are never installed. This option runs the same sops-nix install script
        directly instead.

        An absent `sops.age.keyFile` is treated as the secrets coeffect not
        being present: the entry reports that it skipped the install and
        continues, so a profile can be activated where no key exists, as an
        image or snapshot build must be. Where the key file exists the install
        runs and any failure is fatal. Activating again once the key is in place
        is what installs the secrets.

        The entry probes `systemctl --user is-system-running` and, when a user
        manager is present, restarts the sops-nix unit as sops-nix's own entry
        would. That entry is replaced rather than left in place because it
        restarts unconditionally, and a restart with no key present fails the
        unit and with it the whole activation. Enabling this on a NixOS
        workstation therefore changes nothing but the no-key case. It has no
        effect on darwin, where sops-nix bootstraps its launchd agent from its
        own entry, and none when no secrets are declared.

        The entry runs after `writeBoundary`. Activation entries that read the
        installed secrets should declare `entryAfter [ "sopsInstallWithoutSystemd" ]`
        rather than relying on entry order.
