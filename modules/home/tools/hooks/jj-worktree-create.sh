# shellcheck shell=bash
# Hook: WorktreeCreate -- supply the isolation worktree path
# Replaces Claude Code's default `git worktree add` behavior for all three
# worktree-isolation entry paths (the --worktree launch flag, the EnterWorktree
# tool, and subagent isolation="worktree").
#
# Every repository gets a git worktree under <root>/.claude/worktrees/<name> on
# a fresh branch worktree-<name>. In a jj-managed repository, setting
# CLAUDE_JJ_WORKSPACE_ISOLATION=1 selects a jj workspace at that path instead.
# A jj workspace has no .git, so nix flake evaluation there degrades to a
# revisionless path: source (jj-vcs/jj#4436); a git worktree keeps flake
# fidelity, which is why it is the default in both modes.
#
# Stdin is JSON: {session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name, name}.
# Success: print the created worktree's absolute path on stdout, exit 0.
# Abort: print a message to stderr, exit non-zero.
# WorktreeCreate (sync) -- reads JSON context from stdin.
