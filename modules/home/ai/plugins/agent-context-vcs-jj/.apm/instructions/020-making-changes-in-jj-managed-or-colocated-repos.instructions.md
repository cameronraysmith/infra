## Making changes in jj-managed or colocated repos

The working copy is the integrated surface of every active chain.
All of them are merged into it continuously, so two chains that stop being compatible conflict here, at the keyboard, on the day it happens rather than at integration time.
That is what the rule below protects, and every other rule follows from it, including for verbs not listed here.

The working copy pointer `@` never moves.
Relocating `@` onto a single chain dismantles the integration and strands any concurrent editor coordinating through the shared wip.
Create a change with `jj new --no-edit`, which leaves `@` in place, and land work with `jj squash --into <change> --use-destination-message --keep-emptied`.
Both squash flags are load-bearing: `-u` reuses the destination's description instead of opening the description-merge editor, which hangs a non-interactive session, and `-k` preserves the source, because without `-i` or path arguments a squash always exhausts `@`, and an exhausted source is abandoned and recreated with a new change id and no description.
Path-scoped squash is not exempt when the paths exhaust the source.

Because edits land in the integrated surface unattributed, accumulated change is routed down to the chain it belongs to rather than committed in place: path-scoped `jj squash` for what you can name, `jj absorb` for what blame can route, `jj split` for a change spanning boundaries.
Splice into a chain with `jj new --no-edit -B <tip>`; descendants rebase automatically and a downstream merge keeps every edge, so the join stays intact without being touched.

Read-only inspection takes the global `--ignore-working-copy` so it does not snapshot and race a concurrent session.
Recovery for the destructive class is top-level `jj undo`; there is no `jj op undo`.
See the `jj-version-control` skill for the diamond workflow.
