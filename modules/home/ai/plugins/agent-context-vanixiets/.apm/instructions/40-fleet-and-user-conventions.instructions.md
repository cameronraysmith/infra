description: vanixiets machine and user conventions — provisioning state, admin-username split, and where the authoritative fleet inventory lives.

## Machine configuration

Cloud machines are declared through terranix in `modules/terranix/`, one file per provider.
Each machine carries an `enabled` boolean: setting it to `false` and running `nix run .#terraform` removes the cloud resources while leaving the machine's full NixOS configuration, clan inventory entry, and disko layout in the repository.
A machine present in `machines/` is therefore not necessarily provisioned, and agents should not assume any machine is reachable or attempt remote operations against one.

Two admin-username conventions coexist: older machines force the username `crs58`, and newer ones use `cameron` as a home-manager alias for the same account.
Modules that hardcode a username are following one convention or the other, and which one is a property of the machine.

The authoritative fleet inventory is `modules/clan/inventory/machines.nix`, one entry per machine with its tags and description; the authoritative user list is the set of directories under `modules/home/users/`.
This file intentionally does not reproduce either inventory as a table — consult those paths directly rather than a snapshot that will drift.
