# Devin Outposts workers: one option surface, two service backends.
#
# An outpost is a named QUEUE of sessions in Devin Cloud, not a machine. A
# worker is a process that watches one queue, claims a session, and executes
# every command, file edit, and repository operation locally while Devin's
# planning loop stays in their cloud; it needs outbound HTTPS only. N workers
# on one outpost therefore serve N concurrent sessions.
#
# That is why `outposts` is a registry of queues and `workers` is a count, and
# why queues are NOT named per machine index. Naming them `stibnite-1`,
# `stibnite-2` would partition the queue: a session dispatched to a busy queue
# would wait while its sibling queue sat idle, because the operator picks a
# queue when starting the session and cannot know which worker is free.
# Concurrency belongs on the worker count.
#
# Which queue a host serves is named per host, never derived. `outpost` has no
# default: enabling the service without naming a queue fails evaluation and
# names the host. The tempting inference -- serve the queue whose platform
# matches this host -- is wrong here, because this repository carries six
# NixOS machines and four darwin ones, so it would put every linux host that
# enabled the service onto the same linux queue. Those workers would serve
# another machine's sessions perfectly well, since N workers on one queue
# serve N concurrent sessions, which is exactly why nothing would report it.
# `platform` validates the pairing a host names; it never picks one.
#
# Per host the platform decides the supervisor:
#
#   * darwin gets a launchd USER AGENT, deliberately not a system daemon.
#     Devin's computer-use features drive the machine's existing desktop
#     session and need Screen Recording (screenshots) and Accessibility
#     (input) granted to the worker process. A system daemon has no desktop
#     session, so those features would fail with no configuration error to
#     point at. Note that macOS keys those grants to the executable, which is
#     a store path here: a CLI version bump changes the path and the grants
#     have to be given again.
#
#   * linux gets a user-scoped systemd service. A user manager stops with the
#     last login session, so a host serving a queue with nobody logged in also
#     needs `users.users.<name>.linger = true`. That is a NixOS-level option
#     this module cannot reach from home-manager; for the machines in this
#     repository the clan users inventory already sets it (see
#     modules/clan/inventory/services/users/cameron.nix, which lingers
#     cameron on magnetite among others), so the seam is closed at the layer
#     that owns system users rather than duplicated here.
#
# The two supervisors do not reach exact parity on restart, and the difference
# is stated here rather than implied away. systemd stops a worker that exits
# with the config-error code and retries anything else after 30s
# (`RestartPreventExitStatus`). launchd has no per-exit-code equivalent, and
# its `KeepAlive` dictionary conditions are ORed, so only one is usable:
# `PathState` on the token file. What darwin therefore does on a missing token
# is stop -- there is no path to keep alive, so no respawn -- and start on its
# own once the secret is rendered there. What it does NOT do is distinguish a
# token file that exists but is empty or unreadable: the launcher still refuses
# to start, and launchd still respawns it, every 30s under the
# `ThrottleInterval` set here rather than at its ten-second floor. That case is
# a slow loop on darwin where linux would stop.
#
# Each worker instance gets its own working directory because a session's
# repositories are checked out under `$(pwd)/repos`: two workers sharing a
# directory would race on the same checkout. Each also gets its own explicit
# acceptor id, since the upstream default is generated per worker DATA
# directory -- which the instances on one host share -- and an id must never
# be shared, across instances or across machines.
#
# One token file per queue, for rotation rather than for containment. The web
# UI issues a token when an outpost is created, but a token issued for one
# outpost lists every outpost through the account-level endpoint: measured
# against the live account, these credentials are account-scoped for reads
# despite being issued per outpost. Separate files therefore buy independent
# rotation, not blast-radius containment, and no registry entry may fall back
# to a sibling's file -- a queue without its own token refuses to start, so a
# worker never runs addressed at one queue with another queue's credential.
#
# Rotating one, in three steps:
#
#   1. Rotate the token in the Devin UI for that outpost. No rebuild is
#      needed for this step alone -- nothing in this repository holds the
#      value, and the running worker still holds the old one.
#   2. Replace that one key's value in
#      secrets/home-manager/users/crs58/secrets.yaml. The other outpost's key
#      is a separate entry and is not touched.
#   3. Re-activate that host so the new value reaches the worker's runtime
#      path, then restart the worker service
#      (`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/devin-worker-1` on darwin,
#      `systemctl --user restart devin-worker-1` on linux).
#
# Step 3's restart is not optional: the launcher reads the token from the file
# once, at process start, so a running worker keeps using the old value until
# it is restarted, however current the file on disk has become.

                    Stable identifier the web UI issues for the queue, of the
                    form `outpost_env-<32 hex>`. `devin worker start
                    --outpost=` accepts either a name or an id, and this
                    module passes the id: the name is the operator's label and

                    worker would keep polling and fail when it tried to claim,
                    on a machine nobody is watching.

                    Null until the queue exists, because the id is issued

                    One file per queue, for rotation rather than for
                    containment. The web UI issues a token when an outpost is
                    created, but a token issued for one outpost lists every
                    outpost through the account-level endpoint -- measured
                    against the live account -- so these credentials are
                    account-scoped for reads despite being issued per outpost.
                    Separate files buy independent rotation, not a smaller
                    blast radius.

                    There is deliberately no host-level or module-level token
                    option, so a queue whose file is missing cannot fall back
                    to a sibling's: it refuses to start, and a worker never
                    runs addressed at one queue holding another's credential.

                    The token is a bearer credential, so it must never be
                    written into a Nix store path: not into a rendered
                    configuration file, and not into a launchd plist's
                    EnvironmentVariables or a systemd unit's Environment, both

                    the value through DEVIN_OUTPOSTS_TOKEN.

                    Left null in the registry defaults deliberately: minting
                    the token is an account-level action for the operator, and

            and nothing in this module reaches upstream to do it.

            The fleet's own queues are populated by this module's config layer
            rather than by this option's default, because an option default is
            replaced wholesale by any definition: a caller adding one entry's

            every other entry, and drop the `platform` of the entry it was

            layer a caller writing `outposts."magnetite".tokenFile = ...`
            adds to it. Overriding a value this module sets needs

                No entry falls back to another's file, so this cannot be satisfied by a sibling
                queue's token even though the credentials are account-scoped for reads. Starting
                without one is not a fallback worth taking: the CLI would authenticate as the
                operator's personal login and implicitly create an outpost upstream.

            outpost without a platform and the reference reads that as the account default. This is
            neither a match nor a mismatch here, and the worker's own OS validation is the authority
            when it claims a session. Set the platform on the outpost upstream, and on this entry, to
            have the disagreement caught at evaluation instead.
