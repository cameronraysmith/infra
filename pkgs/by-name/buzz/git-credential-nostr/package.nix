# git-credential-nostr - git credential helper issuing Nostr NIP-98 events.
#
# git is deliberately kept out of nativeBuildInputs. The helper shells out to
# `git config` to read nostr.keyfile, and it is referenced only through the
# wrapper, so git is not on PATH during the install check: a dropped wrapper
# fails the build rather than passing by borrowing a git that happened to be
# present.
#
# The install check drives the real credential protocol rather than probing a
# flag. A request consisting of a single newline returns at the
# has_authtype_capability gate (crates/git-credential-nostr/src/lib.rs:160)
# before any key loading is reached, so a check built on that shape would pass
# against a completely broken key path.
