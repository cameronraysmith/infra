# git-sign-nostr - NIP-GS git object signing program for gpg.x509.program.
#
# Nothing in this repository wires this package. Git resolves gpg.format
# globally with no URL scoping, and modules/home/development/git.nix:20-28
# already sets SSH signing with signByDefault, so wiring it would replace SSH
# signing everywhere rather than adding a capability. It ships for
# per-repository opt-in; see NOTES.md for the recipe.
#
# The git wrapper is mandatory rather than a convenience, on two paths. The
# keyfile is read through `git config nostr.keyfile`, and load_auth_tag reads
# nostr.authtag through git_config_strict, which fails closed when the spawn
# itself fails. The auth-tag path is reached only when BUZZ_AUTH_TAG is unset or
# empty, since a non-empty value short-circuits the git call
# (crates/git-sign-nostr/src/lib.rs:467-475).
#
# meta.platforms is unix-only because the program passes status output over an
# inherited file descriptor selected by --status-fd
# (crates/git-sign-nostr/src/lib.rs:6).

  # Sign then verify what was just signed. This exercises the signing path,
  # which is the program's primary function, and proves the git wrapper twice
  # over: the key is delivered through `git config nostr.keyfile` rather than an
  # environment variable, and load_auth_tag then consults nostr.authtag.
  #
  # The key arrives as a keyfile on purpose. The NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY path would
  # skip open_keyfile entirely, and open_keyfile's symlink, mode and uid gates
  # are exactly what the sops wiring depends on.
  #
  # --status-fd=2 on sign is explicit rather than incidental: passing 1 there
  # would corrupt the armor on stdout, so the program rewrites it to 2 and warns
  # (lib.rs:1741-1747). Relying on that fallback would make the check depend on
  # a recovery path instead of stating the intent.
  #
  # BUZZ_AUTH_TAG is unset explicitly. A non-empty value short-circuits the
  # git_config_strict call, which would leave this check green with a dropped
  # wrapper — the one failure it exists to catch.
  #
  # The -bsau argument is the public key tabulated for this secret in
  # docs/nips/NIP-GS.md:644-645, so signing asserts key derivation against a
  # value the binary did not produce. An empty argument would also sign, since
  # do_sign compares it against the loaded key only when non-empty
  # (crates/git-sign-nostr/src/lib.rs:977-997); the quotes around it would then
  # be load-bearing, as -bsau consumes the next argument.
  #
  # GOODSIG alone would not prove the wrapper. Verification is cryptographically
  # self-contained — it reads the pubkey out of the envelope and never spawns
  # git — so that assertion passes identically with or without the wrapper.
  # TRUST_FULLY is the one that carries severity on the verify side:
  # determine_trust emits it only when `git config user.signingkey` normalizes
  # to the envelope pubkey, and degrades silently to TRUST_UNDEFINED when the
  # git spawn fails (lib.rs:1673-1682). Silent degradation is the verify-side
  # analogue of the credential helper's silent misdirection, whereas the sign
  # side fails loudly through git_config_strict. Asserting both covers both
  # shapes, and the wrapper is then proven on three independent paths: keyfile
  # lookup, auth-tag lookup, and trust determination.
