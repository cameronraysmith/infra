# buzz-cli - command-line client for a Buzz relay.
#
# reqwest 0.13's `rustls` feature implies `__rustls-aws-lc-rs`, so aws-lc-sys
# is compiled from source. aws-lc-sys defaults to its CcBuilder backend;
# AWS_LC_SYS_CMAKE_BUILDER forces the cmake backend instead, matching nixpkgs'
# own unconditional aws-lc-sys crate override (default-crate-overrides.nix:58-62),
# whose comment notes the cc backend fails at least on Darwin. cmake is
# therefore a build tool here rather than the build system, hence
# dontUseCmakeConfigure.
#
# The attribute and pname are buzz-cli while the binary is buzz. mainProgram is
# set, so lib.getExe resolves correctly and `nix run` works. Consumers should
# still prefer `lib.getExe' pkgs.buzz-cli "buzz"`, because getExe falls back to
# getName when mainProgram is absent (lib/meta.nix:525-537): an edit that drops
# mainProgram would leave a deprecation warning easily lost in a large
# evaluation and a path to a nonexistent /bin/buzz-cli, whereas getExe' names
# the binary at the call site and cannot drift.
