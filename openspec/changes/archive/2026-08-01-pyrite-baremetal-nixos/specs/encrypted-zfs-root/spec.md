## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The root is a ZFS pool created with an explicit ashift matching the disk's 4096-byte sectors

The disko layout SHALL declare a `zroot` pool with `options.ashift = "12"` and the fleet's dataset layout (`root`, `root/nixos` at `/`, `root/home` at `/home`, `root/nix` at `/nix`).
`ashift` MUST be set explicitly rather than left to ZFS autodetection.
`rootFsOptions` SHALL additionally carry `xattr = "sa"` and `acltype = "posixacl"`, and `normalization` MUST NOT be set.

#### Scenario: ashift is the caller's responsibility

- **WHEN** the pool is created on a disk reporting 4096-byte logical and physical sector size
- **THEN** `options.ashift = "12"` is set in the layout, because 2^12 = 4096, disko performs no sector-size detection and passes zpool options through verbatim to `zpool create -o`, and ZFS's `ashift=0` autodetect was not verified to arrive at 12 on this device
- **AND** the value carries a comment recording the sector-size coupling, because a reader cannot recover the relationship between `12` and this disk from the literal

#### Scenario: ZFS root matches the fleet, encryption does not follow any in-repo precedent

- **WHEN** the filesystem choice is justified
- **THEN** the justification is that all five existing NixOS machines root on ZFS with a `zroot` pool and none has a non-ZFS root
- **AND** the justification is NOT that `base` sets `boot.zfs.forceImportRoot = true`, which is an unconditional defensive setting inert on a machine with no pool and which proves nothing about ZFS usage
- **AND** the encryption layer is acknowledged as having no in-repo precedent, since no machine in this repository encrypts a disk by any mechanism, and the FIDO2 enrollment has no precedent in clan-infra either — `machines/build01/disko.nix:90-97` is LUKS opened by a passphrase with no token

#### Scenario: the properties whose window closes at creation are decided in this window

- **WHEN** the pool and its root dataset are created by the single destructive install, which is the only scheduled occasion to influence them
- **THEN** `rootFsOptions` carries `xattr = "sa"`, storing extended attributes inline in the dnode rather than in a hidden per-file directory, and `acltype = "posixacl"`, because journald applies POSIX ACLs to the per-user journals it creates under `/var/log/journal` and a pool without `acltype` set drops them
- **AND** these two are decided here rather than deferred, because `zfs set` applies each only to attributes and ACLs written after the change and leaves everything already on disk in the old form, so a retrofit on a populated root is partial in a way the reported property value does not reveal
- **AND** `normalization` is NOT set, and the decline is recorded: it is settable only at creation, and any value other than `none` implicitly sets `utf8only=on`, which makes the filesystem reject filenames that are not valid UTF-8 — a failure mode with no in-repo precedent to justify accepting
- **AND** `ashift` is distinguished from all of the above as the one property with no post-create remedy at all, partial or otherwise

---

### Requirement: The ESP is typed EF00 and sized 1G

The disko layout SHALL declare an ESP partition with `type = "EF00"` and `size = "1G"`, carrying a vfat filesystem mounted at `/boot`, with systemd-boot as the loader.
The partition type MUST be stated explicitly.

#### Scenario: the ESP type is stated because disko's default would brick the boot

- **WHEN** disko's `lib/types/gpt.nix:48-52` defaults a partition's `type` to `"8300"` (Linux filesystem) for any content type other than swap
- **THEN** the layout sets `type = "EF00"` explicitly, because Apple's EFI firmware discovers the ESP by partition type and an `8300`-typed partition is not discoverable as one
- **AND** the field carries a comment recording that the boot depends on it, because the failure surfaces only after macOS has been irreversibly wiped and there is no fallback OS from which to correct it
- **AND** this matches the fleet's three UEFI machines, `modules/machines/nixos/{electrum,galena,scheelite}/disko.nix:15`, each of which sets `type = "EF00"`; cinnabar and magnetite set `EF02` because they are BIOS-boot

#### Scenario: the ESP size is stated because disko's default is zero

- **WHEN** disko's `lib/types/gpt.nix:158-166` defaults `size` to `"0"`
- **THEN** the layout sets `size = "1G"`, matching every existing machine in the fleet

---

### Requirement: A sibling partition carries the ZFS content that becomes the pool's vdev

The disko layout SHALL declare, alongside the ESP, a second GPT partition with `size = "100%"` whose content is `{ type = "luks"; }` and whose nested `content` is `{ type = "zfs"; pool = "zroot"; }`, so the pool's vdev is the `/dev/mapper` device rather than the partition.
The fleet's unencrypted form at `modules/machines/nixos/electrum/disko.nix:22-28` names the zfs content directly on the partition; pyrite interposes the LUKS layer and is otherwise identical.
The pool declared by the `zpool.zroot` block MUST have a device contributing a vdev to it.

#### Scenario: the pool has a device to be created on

- **WHEN** the layout declares a `zpool.zroot` block with its options and datasets
- **THEN** a sibling partition of the ESP carries a LUKS content whose own `content` declares `{ type = "zfs"; pool = "zroot"; }`, because that content type's `_create` at disko `lib/types/zfs.nix:39-43` is the only thing that appends a device to `$disko_devices_dir/zfs_zroot`, which `lib/types/zpool.nix:291` reads back with `readarray` to build the `zpool create` vdev list
- **AND** the device it appends is `/dev/mapper/<name>`, because the LUKS type fixes its nested content's `device` to exactly that at disko `lib/types/luks.nix:184-187` and splices that content's `_create` after the container has been formatted and opened (`lib/types/luks.nix:303`)
- **AND** the partition takes `size = "100%"`, consuming the disk remaining after the 1G ESP

#### Scenario: an ESP-only layout fails after the disk is already destroyed

- **WHEN** a layout declares the ESP and the `zpool.zroot` block but no partition carrying zfs content
- **THEN** nothing appends to `$disko_devices_dir/zfs_zroot`, and disko's guard at `lib/types/zpool.nix:292-295` exits 1 with "no devices found for zpool zroot. Did you misspell the pool name?"
- **AND** the failure surfaces during the install's create phase, after the recorded wipe has already destroyed macOS and with no fallback OS to correct it from, which is why the partition is declared and evaluated before the install rather than discovered at it

---

### Requirement: The pool device is named by a namespace-explicit by-id path

The disko `device` SHALL be `/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-APPLE_SSD_AP0512J_C08843605KKHV4MAK_1`, and the module SHALL set `boot.zfs.devNodes = "/dev/disk/by-id"` rather than the `by-path` every existing machine uses.
The device MUST NOT be named by any prefix or glob over the by-id family.

#### Scenario: the 8 KiB second namespace is never a write target

- **WHEN** the controller exposes two namespaces, `nvme0n1` (the 465.9 GiB disk) and `nvme0n2` (8 KiB), whose by-id names differ only by a `_1`/`_2` suffix and share a common unsuffixed prefix
- **THEN** the layout names `_1` explicitly, because the unsuffixed name is a bare prefix of both suffixed names and any prefix or glob match over the family can reach `_2`
- **AND** the device carries a comment recording the `_2` namespace, because the hazard is not recoverable from the path literal
- **AND** ZFS scanning `_2` during import is harmless, since the hazard is a write and only the disko `device` writes

#### Scenario: by-path is not inherited from the cloud machines

- **WHEN** every existing machine sets `boot.zfs.devNodes = "/dev/disk/by-path"` with a comment reading "more stable for cloud VMs"
- **THEN** pyrite sets `by-id` instead, because that reasoning is scoped to cloud VMs and this machine has a stable by-id path

---

### Requirement: The pool sits inside a LUKS2 container holding the clan-vars passphrase in slot 0 and a FIDO2 token in each of slots 1 and 2

The disko layout SHALL wrap the 100% partition in `content = { type = "luks"; }` carrying `enrollFido2 = false`, and the `zroot` pool SHALL take the resulting `/dev/mapper` device as its vdev.
The container SHALL reach an end state holding three keyslots: slot 0 holding a human-typeable passphrase supplied as a clan vars partitioning secret under argon2id, and slots 1 and 2 each carrying a `systemd-fido2` token that `systemd-cryptenroll` writes for one of the two YubiKey 5C Nano tokens.
It reaches that end state in two stages (D30): the install creates the container with the passphrase alone, and the tokens are enrolled afterward on the booted machine.
The container as the install leaves it SHALL hold the passphrase and no FIDO2 token, and that is compliance rather than an incomplete result.
`settings.allowDiscards` and `settings.bypassWorkqueues` SHALL both be `true`, and `enrollRecovery` SHALL be `false`.
ZFS native encryption MUST NOT be used: no dataset carries `encryption`, `keyformat`, or `keylocation`, and no `postCreateHook` flips a key location.

#### Scenario: the create-time key arrives through clan's partitioning-secrets channel

- **WHEN** `clan.core.vars.generators.zfs` declares `files.key.neededFor = "partitioning"`
- **THEN** clan-core resolves that file's `path` to `/run/partitioning-secrets/zfs/key`, per `nixosModules/clanCore/vars/secret/sops/default.nix:30-32`
- **AND** `clan machines install` places the file there automatically, because `pkgs/clan-cli/clan_lib/machines/install.py:171-182` rglob-walks the generated partitioning-secrets tree and appends one `--disk-encryption-keys <remote path> <local path>` pair per file to the `nixos-anywhere` invocation
- **AND** the LUKS content names that same generator path in both `passwordFile` and `additionalKeyFiles`, following clan-infra `machines/build01/disko.nix:93`'s `passwordFile` form, so the file that opens the container during the install is also the file added as a persistent keyslot

#### Scenario: the generated key is a human-typeable passphrase, not hex

- **WHEN** the vars generator script produces the key
- **THEN** it emits a human-typeable passphrase with `xkcdpass --numwords 6 --delimiter - --case random`, adapting clan-infra `machines/build01/disko.nix:71-80`'s `xkcdpass --numwords 6 --random-delimiters --case random` (the same generator shape build01 feeds to its own LUKS `passwordFile` at `machines/build01/disko.nix:93`) by fixing the delimiter to a layout-stable hyphen per D27
- **AND** it MUST NOT emit hex via `dd if=/dev/urandom | xxd` as clan-infra `web01` does, because `web01` is a server unlocked over the network by another machine while pyrite's passphrase is typed by a person standing at the machine whenever the token is absent, forgotten, or broken
- **AND** this passphrase is the recovery credential of record, which is why disko's `enrollRecovery` is declined rather than used in its place: the passphrase already exists, is already replicated in sops, and is already transcribable, whereas disko's recovery key is shown once as a QR code on the console behind a `read -p` (`lib/types/luks.nix:264-274`) that would block a non-interactive install outright

#### Scenario: the passphrase is the container's format credential, and no slot-zero wipe occurs

- **WHEN** `enrollFido2 = false` leaves disko's `autogeneratedPassword` false at `lib/types/luks.nix:12`
- **THEN** `formatKeyFile` resolves to `keyFile` (`:32-33`), which for a non-null `passwordFile` is the command substitution at `:23`, so `cryptsetup -q luksFormat` at `:244` formats the container with the clan-vars passphrase itself and slot 0 holds it
- **AND** the throwaway-key block at `:232-243` is `lib.optionalString autogeneratedPassword`-gated and is not emitted, so no `openssl rand -hex 32` key is minted, `SLOT_ZERO_TO_DELETE` is never exported, and the `systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto --wipe-slot=0` block at `:275-302` is not emitted either
- **AND** the `additionalKeyFiles` loop at `:256-262` adds nothing, because its `cryptsetup open --test-passphrase --key-file=<path>` guard at `:258` succeeds against the same file, so the `luksAddKey` at `:259` does not run
- **AND** the ordering argument this scenario previously recorded is retained in design.md D4 rather than deleted, because it governs any future run that sets `enrollFido2 = true`; under D30 the container's single typeable credential is secured by there being nothing else in the header rather than by a sequence
- **AND** the built `disko --mode disko` script is the evidence for all of the above rather than the nix source: it carries zero occurrences of `systemd-cryptenroll`, `--wipe-slot`, `wait_for_token`, `hidraw`, `SLOT_ZERO_TO_DELETE`, `openssl rand`, and `systemd-ask-password`

#### Scenario: the generator strips the trailing newline, because disko's two key paths disagree about it

- **WHEN** the same generator file is named in both `passwordFile` and `additionalKeyFiles`
- **THEN** the generator script appends `| tr -d "\n"`, matching clan-infra `machines/build01/disko.nix:78`
- **AND** the reason is that disko reads the file two different ways: `passwordFile` is dereferenced through a command substitution at `lib/types/luks.nix:23`, `<(set +x; echo -n "$(cat ...)"; set -x)`, which drops trailing newlines, while the `additionalKeyFiles` arm reads it verbatim — the guard at `:258` passes it as `--key-file=<path>` and `cryptsetup luksAddKey` at `:259` would do the same, and cryptsetup reads a regular key file including its final byte
- **AND** under `enrollFido2 = false` the stripping substitution is what `luksFormat` consumes at `:244`, so slot 0 holds the trimmed passphrase, and the consequence of omitting the trim relocates: the `:258` guard fails against a newline-bearing file, re-activating the `luksAddKey` and adding a second slot whose credential carries a newline that no path presenting the passphrase ever supplies
- **AND** the trim is therefore what keeps the container at one keyslot and keeps that keyslot typeable, where under the previous shape it was what kept the single added keyslot from being dead
- **AND** this reverses the guidance the ZFS-native design recorded, which forbade the trim on the ground that ZFS strips one trailing newline itself for non-RAW keyformats; that reasoning was specific to ZFS keyformat handling and does not survive the move to LUKS

#### Scenario: the layout re-formats the container rather than reusing it on any later reinstall

- **WHEN** the install path is run against a disk that already holds a LUKS container
- **THEN** disko's guard at `lib/types/luks.nix:202`, `if ! blkid "<device>" >/dev/null || ! cryptsetup isLuks "<device>"`, finds no LUKS header on a disk the recorded `blkdiscard` has discarded, and re-runs the whole format-add-enroll sequence
- **AND** against a container that survived the wipe it would skip the format entirely, which is the same tautological green the create-path requirement in `bare-metal-install-path` forbids for the pool; the FIDO2 arm of that skip at `lib/types/luks.nix:276` is not reachable under `enrollFido2 = false`, because the whole `:275-302` block is not emitted
- **AND** this is an acceptance criterion of this change rather than only a property of the layout, because the disk no longer starts clean: the aborted attempt of 2026-07-30 left a valid LUKS2 container on p2, and `blkid`/`cryptsetup isLuks` both succeed against it, so the `:202` guard would skip `luksFormat` unless the media is discarded first
- **AND** the mapping that attempt left open must be closed before the discard, because disko opened it `--persistent` at `:246-247` and `blkdiscard` fails on a busy device

#### Scenario: the boot-time unlock reaches the console and needs no new stage-1 options

- **WHEN** the machine boots with `boot.initrd.systemd.enable = true`, which `base` already sets at `modules/system/initrd-networking.nix:7` and which disko would set anyway for a FIDO2 container (`lib/types/luks.nix:354`)
- **THEN** disko's `_config` emits a `boot.initrd.luks.devices.<name>` entry, nixpkgs renders it into the stage-1 crypttab at `nixos/modules/system/boot/luksroot.nix:590-598` and installs that file as `/etc/crypttab` at `:1221`, and `systemd-cryptsetup` unlocks the container before ZFS is asked to import anything
- **AND** that entry carries no `fido2-device=auto` option, at the install and permanently: disko emits `crypttabExtraOpts` under `lib.mkIf config.enrollFido2` (`lib/types/luks.nix:348`) and `enrollFido2` is false, and no such option is added by hand afterward, so `nix eval --json .#nixosConfigurations.pyrite.config.boot.initrd.luks.devices.cryptroot.crypttabExtraOpts` returns `[]` against the deployed configuration and `determine_token_type` returns `_TOKEN_TYPE_INVALID` on every boot
- **AND** in the window between the install and the first enrollment the header carried no token at all, so the token-plugin path that runs ahead of the unlock loop found nothing in it and stage 1 requested the passphrase directly with no token prompt of any kind and no preceding wait, which is what the first boot observed
- **AND** the option is NOT added after the enrollments, because an enrolled header is by itself sufficient: the libcryptsetup token-plugin path runs ahead of the unlock loop and reaches the token without any crypttab option — `if (!key_file && use_token_plugins())` (systemd 260.2 `src/cryptsetup/cryptsetup.c:2691`) calls `crypt_activate_by_token_pin_ask_password`, which tries `crypt_activate_by_token_pin(..., CRYPT_ANY_TOKEN, ...)` at `:1557` and returns 0 on success — and token unlock was exercised on the installed machine with both tokens seated and with each token alone
- **AND** the reasoning an earlier revision recorded is falsified by that observation and is withdrawn: it held that `determine_token_type` (`:2551-2560`) selects `TOKEN_FIDO2` at `:2555` only from `arg_fido2_device` or `arg_fido2_device_auto`, which crypttab's `fido2-device=` (`:394-405`) and `fido2-cid=` (`:424-426`) set, and that the token-plugin path loads no token module here, from which it concluded that upstream's "if necessary, configure the corresponding crypttab(5) options" clause was the whole of the mechanism; upstream `luksroot.nix:614`'s hedge that systemd "usually" detects the configuration at runtime names that plugin path, and on this machine the "usually" branch is what runs
- **AND** the option is declined rather than merely unnecessary, because setting it would give `determine_token_type` a `TOKEN_FIDO2` to return and move the unlock onto systemd's own FIDO2 path, which is not the path the token unlock and the passphrase fallback were verified on
- **AND** the failure mode of leaving it unset is graceful: if a nixpkgs bump moves the plugin off the loader search path, token unlock stops and the boot degrades to the passphrase prompt, which is proven reachable
- **AND** no stage-1 option is added for this: `boot.initrd.systemd.fido2.enable` defaults to `config.boot.initrd.systemd.package.withFido2` at `nixos/modules/system/boot/systemd/fido2.nix:12-15`, and its config block at `:19-30` already places `60-fido-id.rules`, `fido_id`, `libcryptsetup-token-systemd-fido2.so`, and `libfido2.so.1` inside the initrd — all four confirmed present by extracting the deployed initrd, whose `/init` symlinks to systemd
- **AND** presence in the initrd is presence on libcryptsetup's search path, because `pkgs/by-name/cr/cryptsetup/package.nix:45-48` applies `relative-token-path.patch`, which rewrites `crypt_token_load_external` in `lib/luks2/luks2_token.c` to `dlopen` a bare `libcryptsetup-token-systemd-fido2.so` rather than a path built from `crypt_token_external_path()`; an earlier revision recorded these as separate facts on the ground that the plugin ships under the systemd prefix while libcryptsetup's compile-time token directory is empty, which measured a value the patched load does not use
- **AND** `settings.allowDiscards` and `settings.bypassWorkqueues` reach the running system rather than only the install, because `luksroot.nix:590-598` folds them into the crypttab options as `discard`, `no-read-workqueue`, and `no-write-workqueue`
- **AND** at the end state both tokens carry a FIDO2 client PIN, so `systemd-cryptenroll`'s default `--fido2-with-client-pin=yes` applies and the unlock is a typed PIN followed by a physical touch; between the install and the first enrollment the unlock was the passphrase typed on the same keyboard, so the SPI keyboard requirement recorded in `apple-laptop-hardware-support` is load-bearing in both states rather than only the end state
- **AND** the passphrase fallback is reachable but is not automatic, which was established on the hardware: with no token seated the prompt reads "Please enter LUKS2 token PIN", there is no device-absent timeout, and pressing Enter on an empty PIN is what falls through to the passphrase prompt, after which the machine boots normally. An operator holding the passphrase but not the tokens, who did not know about that keypress, could read the prompt as an unbootable machine
- **AND** the prompt is rendered by `systemd-ask-password-console.service`, which is started by `systemd-ask-password-console.path`'s level-triggered `DirectoryNotEmpty=/run/systemd/ask-password` rather than by the unit's `After=` on it — that `After=` edge is vacuous because the service is not in the boot transaction, and nothing in this design depends on it
- **AND** `i915` in initrd provides the framebuffer console that displays it

#### Scenario: hostId is inherited rather than pinned

- **WHEN** ZFS requires `networking.hostId`
- **THEN** pyrite sets nothing and inherits clan-core's `nixosModules/clanCore/zfs.nix:10` `lib.mkDefault "8425e349"`, whose stated purpose is to match the install ISO and nixos-anywhere so that the installer that creates the pool and the system that imports it present the same hostid
- **AND** a machine-specific hostid is NOT pinned, because it would manufacture the very mismatch that default exists to prevent

#### Scenario: forceImportRoot is kept as a deliberate decision

- **WHEN** `base` supplies `boot.zfs.forceImportRoot = true`
- **THEN** pyrite keeps it, because the install path touches the pool from the installer environment and, per Mic92's `nixosModules/zfs.nix:16-18`, importing without force after such a touch lands the next boot in an emergency shell
- **AND** its known cost, that the nixpkgs assertion `unsafeAllowHibernation -> !forceImportRoot` forecloses ZFS hibernation at evaluation time, is accepted because hibernation is a non-goal of this change

---

### Requirement: The costs and the gains of the LUKS layer are both recorded rather than discovered later

The design SHALL record what moving from ZFS native encryption to a LUKS2 container costs and what it gains, because both are structural and neither is remediable by configuration.

#### Scenario: there are several keyslots and a defined recovery path

- **WHEN** the container is created and enrolled
- **THEN** it is recorded that LUKS2 holds several independent keyslots, and that this design occupies three of them — two FIDO2 tokens and the clan-vars passphrase — so losing one credential does not lose the disk
- **AND** it is recorded that the passphrase is a committed, sops-encrypted clan var, which makes it the recovery credential and closes the escrow gap the ZFS-native design accepted
- **AND** it is recorded that the second YubiKey, and any later TPM enrollment on a machine that had one, are `systemd-cryptenroll` operations against the existing container requiring no re-install, which is exactly the property ZFS native encryption structurally could not offer, since it permits one key per encryption root and `zfs change-key` replaces rather than adds

#### Scenario: pool and dataset metadata are encrypted

- **WHEN** an attacker obtains the disk
- **THEN** it is recorded that the container encrypts everything above it, so pool layout, dataset names, and snapshot names are unreadable, and only the LUKS header and the 1G ESP remain legible
- **AND** it is recorded that this inverts the cost the ZFS-native design accepted, under which those names were readable and only dataset contents were protected

#### Scenario: dm-crypt's AES-XTS is unauthenticated, where ZFS native aes-256-gcm was not

- **WHEN** a byte on the disk is altered, by a fault or by an adversary with write access
- **THEN** it is recorded that LUKS2's default `aes-xts-plain64` provides confidentiality without integrity, so the block layer decrypts altered ciphertext into altered plaintext and raises nothing on its own
- **AND** it is recorded that ZFS's `aes-256-gcm` was authenticated, and that this design gives that property up deliberately rather than by oversight
- **AND** it is recorded that ZFS checksums above the container still detect the resulting corruption, so the data is not silently served, while nothing distinguishes a deliberate modification from bit rot — the detection survives the change, the attribution does not

---

### Requirement: The LUKS header and the keyslot inventory are maintained artifacts, not install-time byproducts

A LUKS2 header backup SHALL be taken once the container's keyslots reach their intended state, stored off the machine, and handled as key material.
The slot index each credential occupies SHALL be recorded at the time it is enrolled.
Revoking a credential SHALL wipe its slot and re-take the header backup.

#### Scenario: a lost header loses the pool regardless of which credentials are held

- **WHEN** the LUKS2 header at the head of the partition is corrupted or overwritten
- **THEN** it is recorded that no enrolled credential recovers the pool, because every keyslot lives inside that header, and that this is a failure mode the ZFS-native design did not have — there was no header to lose
- **AND** the header is backed up with `cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup` once enrollment settles, and the backup is stored off the machine and handled as key material, because it contains the keyslots themselves

#### Scenario: a stale header backup silently restores a revoked credential

- **WHEN** a header backup is taken, a credential is later revoked, and the old backup is then restored
- **THEN** it is recorded that the restore reinstates the revoked keyslot verbatim, because a header backup freezes the keyslot set as of the moment it was taken and carries no notion of a later revocation
- **AND** the procedure is therefore to re-take the backup after every enrollment change and destroy the superseded copy, rather than to accumulate backups

#### Scenario: `systemd-cryptenroll`'s listing does not tell the two tokens apart, and the map is recoverable by other means

- **WHEN** both YubiKey 5C Nano tokens are enrolled and `systemd-cryptenroll <device>` lists the resulting slots
- **THEN** the slot index each token occupies is recorded as it is enrolled, because the two report the same AAGUID and that listing offers nothing else that tells them apart
- **AND** the map is nonetheless reconstructable after the fact, and the claim an earlier revision recorded that it is not is withdrawn: each `systemd-fido2` token names the keyslot it belongs to, which `cryptsetup token export --token-id <n>` prints, and `ykman list` reports the serial of whichever token is seated, so seating one token alone pairs a serial with a slot
- **AND** the record is taken anyway, because it costs one line and the reconstruction needs both tokens in hand, which is the condition a lost token removes
- **AND** the map as recorded is YubiKey A serial `32720759` at keyslot 1, YubiKey B serial `32720546` at keyslot 2, and keyslot 0 holding the clan-vars passphrase under argon2id

#### Scenario: revocation is a slot wipe followed by a fresh header backup

- **WHEN** a token is lost or a credential is to be retired
- **THEN** the procedure is to list slots with `systemd-cryptenroll <device>`, wipe the identified one with `systemd-cryptenroll --wipe-slot=<n> <device>`, enroll the replacement with only that token seated, and re-take the header backup
- **AND** the passphrase slot is not wiped as part of this, because it is the credential that makes the sequence survivable if the replacement enrollment fails partway
